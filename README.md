## General info
I had a project a while back and had to implement Authentication and Authorization from scratch. It was a nightmare. 

I stumbled upon Auth0 as I was learning to use Hasura. I used Auth0 to connect to the Hasura database API to manage authorization and authentication to my backend.

I finished the task at hand but had no grasp of how Auth0 worked. So I thought it  might be a good idea to try it out. At the time, I was learning React so why not? Hence this website.

Do you want to see how the code runs on your local machine. Just do the basics;

1. Clone the repository with git.
2. Open the project folder and run `yarn` from the terminal/command line.
3. Start a dev server with `yarn start`. 
4. The browser will launch automatically and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
